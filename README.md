**Pig Truffle 3D** is a 3D browser game where you play as a pig hunting for valuable truffles! Explore, sniff, dig, and play the market to pay your taxes and survive.

## How to Play:

* **Move:** Use `WASD` keys.
* **Listen:** Truffle sounds get louder and pulse as you enter the dig range.
* **Dig:** `Left Click` when the sound is strong and pulsing.
* **Sell:** Click truffles in your inventory (bottom of screen) or use the "Market" button to view the trends. Prices change and adapt to your selling behaviour!
* **Taxes:** Due at 5:00 AM daily. Don't go into debt!
* **Goal:** Earn money, pay taxes, and survive as long as you can.

Explore different areas to find various truffles. 
The swamp and the forest are home to most species, hover over the species names in your inventory bar to view their rarities!
The open heath biome has less truffles buts home to the most expensive kind - if you're lucky enough.
